# Scratch / PenguinMod "Server Storage" Extension Server
Server Backend for the "Server Storage" extension on PenguinMod
**Works on static hosting with a DB!**

To setup, drop the files into a directory somewhere on your server
Then update the database credentials in `bootstrap.php`
Use a string block in PenguinMod on the set server URL block
and set it to the URL of your server and where the files are located.

You're done!
